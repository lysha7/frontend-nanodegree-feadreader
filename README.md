## About

This project is part of a Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree project. We were given a feed reader app and an incomplete Jasmine test suite, and we were asked to complete the test suite with specific unit tests.

## Installation

No installation is required. To view the feed reader and test results, download the files and open index.html. To view and explore the code used for the unit tests, open the file jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.
